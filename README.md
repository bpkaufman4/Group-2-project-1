## Concept
When searching for TicketMaster events in a state, COVID data also displays for that state to see risk at-a-glance.

## Motivation
As we attempt to return to normal activities and attend events and concerts, there is still a risk for COVID, especially the new Delta strain. This page gives risk of exposure and reward of entertainment in the same view.

## User Story
AS A Covid-concerned event enthusiast 
I WANT a website that can give me information regarding events in my area as well as COVID statistics 
SO THAT I can make informed decisions regarding attending events responsibly.
